                    <p>The Sustainability Cell in association with the Hostel Affairs Council, IIT Bombay have launched

                        waste

                        sustainability
                        by
                        facilitating the efficient disposal and recycling of waste materials, reducing the overall
                        carbon
                        footprint of
                        the campus. This practice enhances resource conservation, as separated waste streams can be
                        processed more
                        effectively, diverting recyclable materials away from landfills. <!--Additionally, a culture of waste bin

                    <p>We are working with Professors Vikram Vishal (Earth Science) and Arnab Dutta (Chemistry) to
                        gather
                        information and perform a thorough carbon footprint assessment of the IIT Bombay campus in order
                        to
                        benchmark
                        the institute's development and create suggestions for enhancing our carbon performance. The
                        emission breakup
                        is :- 95% from Scope 2, 4.4% from Scope 1 and 0.6% from Scope 3.</p>

                        recycling and utilized waste cycle cardboard boxes to convey powerful air pollution messages.

            <h3>Bisleri Knowledge Partnership</h3>
            <p>The association is dedicated to educating housekeeping staff, students, and teaching staff on responsible
                plastic usage
                and recycling. This involves sensitizing individuals about proper plastic disposal, ensuring regular
                collection for
                recycling, and maintaining a yearly database of plastic collection on campus. The collaboration with
                Bisleri
                signifies a
                commitment to sustainability, with a focus on raising awareness and fostering a sense of responsibility
                among
                participants and students for future environmental conservation.
                <br>
                As part of this initiative, the association has actively supported Bisleri in promoting awareness,
                emphasizing the
                importance of recycling, reducing, and reusing plastic materials. They have showcased examples of
                transformed plastic
                into environmentally responsible products, providing a hands-on understanding of the recycling process.
                This
                collective
                effort aims to make a positive impact on their mission to promote sustainability and responsible
